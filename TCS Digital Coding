Explanation:
 * Get input values:
   * The code starts by getting the input values for p1, p2, p3, q, and r from the user using the Scanner class.
 * Calculate the number of employees who solved exactly one problem:
   * The number of employees who solved only the first problem is p1 - q.
   * The number of employees who solved only the second problem is p2 - q.
   * The number of employees who solved only the third problem is p3 - q.
   * The total number of employees who solved exactly one problem is the sum of these three values.
 * Calculate the number of employees who solved the first problem:
   * The number of employees who solved the first problem includes those who solved only the first problem (p1 - q), those who solved all three problems (q), and those who solved the first and third problems (p3 - q).
 * Print the results:
   * The code prints the calculated values for the number of employees who solved the first problem and the number of employees who solved exactly one problem.
Example Usage:
If the input values are:
20 15 18 5 10

The output will be:
Number of employees who solved the first problem: 28
Number of employees who solved exactly one of the 3 problems: 28




import java.util.Scanner;

        // Get input values
        int p1 = scanner.nextInt();
        int p2 = scanner.nextInt();
        int p3 = scanner.nextInt();
        int q = scanner.nextInt();
        int r = scanner.nextInt();

        // Calculate the number of employees who solved exactly one problem
        int oneProblem = (p1 - q) + (p2 - q) + (p3 - q);

        // Calculate the number of employees who solved the first problem
        int firstProblem = (p1 - q) + q + (p3 - q);

        // Print the results
        System.out.println("Number of employees who solved the first problem: " + firstProblem);
        System.out.println("Number of employees who solved exactly one of the 3 problems: " + oneProblem);

        scanner.close();
    }
